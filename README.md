# Learn To Code Q&A

This is a student project where we learn to solve coding problems.

For this purpose, we will design a website where we can ask questions and answer them.

The students can post both questions and answers.

There will be 3 levels of users:
1. Admin
2. student
3. Moderator

Admin is moderator by default, however, a student can also become a moderator.
